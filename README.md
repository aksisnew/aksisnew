## 📝 A Thought I Live By
> In life, very few people will fully support you —  
> learn to be that person for yourself.

> Not halfway. Not casually. Not for approval.

> Some people only want to see results, not understand the process or your feelings.  
> Don’t let that decide your direction.

> Whether everything is meaningless or everything has meaning —  
> keep building anyway.
