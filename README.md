## Some little words from me 
In life almost no one except one person is gonna fully support you so learn to be that person's fully . Not halfway Not casually Not in open.Some people just wanna see you earn but dont try to understand your feelings and what you really want to do . That person is not you !. 
 And neither anything is meaningless in life nor anything really has any intrinsic value either everything is meaningless or everything is meaningful so, if someone says what you are doing is meaningless even if it is keep doing it don't listen!
